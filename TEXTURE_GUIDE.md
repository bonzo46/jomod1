# Better TNT Texture Guide

## What You Need to Create

You need to create a **16x16 pixel PNG image** for the Better TNT block.

### Location
Save the image here:
```
src/main/resources/assets/johannmod/textures/block/better_tnt.png
```

### How It Should Look

Based on Johann's design:
- **Main block**: Should look like a regular TNT block (red with white "TNT" text)
- **4 Corner Pieces**: Add 4 smaller TNT blocks in each corner (top-left, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right)

### Creating the Texture

#### Option 1: Use an Image Editor (Recommended)
1. Open an image editor like:
   - **Paint.NET** (free, easy to use)
   - **GIMP** (free, more advanced)
   - **Aseprite** (paid, made for pixel art)
   - **Minecraft Texture Creator** online tools

2. Create a new **16x16 pixel** image

3. Start with the vanilla TNT texture as a base (you can find it online or extract it from Minecraft)

4. Add 4 small TNT symbols in the corners (maybe 3x3 pixels each)

#### Option 2: Copy and Modify Vanilla TNT
1. Find the vanilla TNT texture online or extract it from Minecraft
2. Copy it as your base
3. Use an editor to add the small corner pieces

### Tips
- Keep it simple - Minecraft textures are small (16x16 pixels)
- Use the same colors as vanilla TNT (red background, white text/symbols)
- Make sure it's saved as **PNG format**
- The corners should be small but visible

### Quick Start (Temporary)
For now, you can use the vanilla TNT texture as a placeholder:
- Download vanilla TNT texture
- Save it to the location above
- Test the mod to make sure everything works
- Then create your custom version with the corner pieces

## Testing Your Texture
After creating the texture:
1. Place it in the correct folder
2. Build the mod in IntelliJ IDEA
3. Launch Minecraft
4. Find "Better TNT" in the Creative Redstone tab
5. Place it in the world to see your texture!
